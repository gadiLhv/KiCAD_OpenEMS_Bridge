In order for this to work, you need:

1. A working copy of OpenEMS, found here https://www.openems.de/, with working Matlab\Octave interface
2. My EM2D_Solver. I want to separate this in the future, but for now: https://github.com/gadiLhv/EM2D_Solver
3. Preferably Octave, I didn't test this on Matlab
4. If Octave, "geometry" and "miscellaneous" packages installed

How to use this:

1. Export you design from KiCAD, using the "Plot" menu. Make sure:
	1.a. You are using Milimeters
	1.b. You are only exporting the layers you need, along with "edge-cuts". Anything else will cause bugs. 
	1.c. "Plot graphic items using their contours" is UNCHECKED
	1.d. Export only drills, not drill map. Also using milimeters.

2. There is an example run script supplied, 'setup_and_run.m'. Use it as reference, change paths as necessary.

3. All model preparation scripts (import, port placement) only need to be run once per-model. Don't run them each time.
